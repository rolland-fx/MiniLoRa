**PCB dimension**

| D| mm|
| --- | --- |
| L | 50 |
| W | 32 |
| H | 12,5* |

* including GNSS module and JST connector

**PCB Info**

Design with Kicad 9.0

* Full schematic and design can be found under **HW\PCB**
* Production files for the current batch are also included
* Libraries used can be found under **HW\PCB\lib**

**Enclosure Info**

Design with FreeCad 1.0

* Very basic and not finished
* Can be 3D printed with basic HW
* Should be improved in the future
* Thought to be attached to backpack

## üíæ Software Overview

## üöÄTo Do and Next Steps

Here are the idea for the next improvement and developpement :

### Software

* Create a first full version in Arduino
* Create a better / smaller / mor realiable version directly with FreeRTOS
* User inteface with one button
* BLE app for phones and PC
* App for configuration via USB-C

### Hardware

* Size can me optimized
* I2C pads for external sensors
* External BMS for energy harversting
* Pressure sensor (or Temp / Hum / Pressure)
* 1-PPS connection to MCU from GPS
* GNSS module with external flat antenna
